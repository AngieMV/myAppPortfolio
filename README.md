# Project 0. My App portfolio

The goals of this project are:
* Build an app layout that showcases the apps I will build across your Nanodegree journey.
* To introduce me to the process of submitting a project for review.
* To familiarize me with the experience of receiving feedback on your work from Udacity reviewers.
